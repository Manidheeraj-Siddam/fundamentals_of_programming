- Avoid using global variables in Python function coding; however, you can use global constants for clearer code.

- Do not use parentheses in `if` and `while` statements.

- In the `kaprekar` function, I utilized a `while` statement by comparing the result with the Kaprekar constant 6174 instead of
  terminating the loop when the number becomes equal to the previous number. This is because 6174 represents the desired 
  outcome of the program, not the termination condition.
